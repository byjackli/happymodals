# [Happy Modals](https://happymodals.com) &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/happymodals)

Happy Modals allows developers a stress-free experience of implementing modals (aka dialogs).

* **Barebones:** To minimize design influences, Happy Modals only considers the bare minimum user accessibility requirements. This leaves room for the develoepr and designer to get creative.* 
**Accessibility:** In addition to end-to-end Playwright tests, this package is also manually tested on all major devices against all major browser engines and major assistant technologies.
* **Dumb-Simple:** The most simple way to get started is creating an element with the class "modal-open" that is immediately preceeded by an element with the role="dialog" attribute.

## Lite vs Standard version

The lite version has the most barebone features with the easiest setup and developer experience. All versions include
* custom modal backdrop
* custom open/close buttons
* automatic scroll-lock
* automatic backdrop/close buttons

Unlike the lite version, the standard version exposes granular controls over the modal, as well as more features. The only requirement being that you are using one of the compatible frameworks.
* dynamically render/import components
* lifecycle hooks (before/after open/close)
* exposes close function

## Installation

* See [how it works](https://happymodals.com/docs/howiw) behind the scenes.
