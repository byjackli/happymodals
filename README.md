# [Happy Modals](https://happymodals.com) &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/happymodals)

Happy Modals allows developers a stress-free experience of implementing modals (aka dialogs).

* **Barebones:** Almost no pre-applied styling; you control how your modals look and feel.
* **Accessibility:** Manually tested on all major devices against all major browser engines and major assistant technologies.
* **Dumb-Simple:** Can't imagine anything simpler than this package, [jump to example code](#example-code).

[Learn how to use Happy Modals](https://happymodals.com/docs).

## Lite vs Standard version
The lite version has the most barebone features with the easiest setup and developer experience. Lite version is written in vanilla JavaScript. All versions include
* custom modal backdrop
* custom open/close buttons
* automatic scroll-lock
* automatic backdrop/close buttons

Unlike the lite version, the standard version exposes granular controls over the modal, as well as more features. The only requirement being that you are using one of the compatible frameworks. Standard version is currently only available for Svelte.
* dynamically render/import components
* lifecycle hooks (before/after open/close)
* exposes close function
* fixed position and sticky position
